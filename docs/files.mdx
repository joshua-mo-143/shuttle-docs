## Files uploaded in deployment

When you run `shuttle deploy`, all source files in your cargo workspace that are not ignored by `.gitignore` or `.ignore` rules are packed into a zip archive and uploaded to Shuttle, where they are then extracted, built, and hosted.

<Info>The deployment POST request (after archive compression) has a size limit of 100 MB.</Info>

### Ignore files

Ignoring files can be done by adding rules to `.gitignore` or `.ignore` files, depending on if you want to exclude them from version control or not.

### Include ignored files

If you have ignored files that you want to include in the deployment upload, declare those files in the `Shuttle.toml` file in the root of your workspace:

```toml Shuttle.toml
# Declare ignored files that should be included in deployment:
[deploy]
include = [
  "file.txt", # include file.txt
  "frontend/dist/*", # include all files and subdirs in frontend/dist/
  "static/*", # include all files and subdirs in static/
]
```

<Note>Specifying only a folder name, like `"static"`, does not work. Use `"static/*"` instead to include its contents.</Note>

### Debug deployment files

You can double check which files are included in your deployment by turning on detailed logging:

```bash
shuttle deploy --debug
```

or inspect the archive after writing it to disk:

```bash
shuttle deploy --output-archive deployment.zip
```

### Block dirty deployments

If you want the `deploy` command to exit if there are uncommitted git changes:

```toml Shuttle.toml
[deploy]
deny_dirty = true
```

## Build assets

Serving a web project often means that there are static HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to serve.

To serve them on Shuttle, make sure they are included in the deployment (if they are gitignored, see above).
Then, add `[build]` configuration in `Shuttle.toml` to copy them from the builder to the final runtime image:

```toml Shuttle.toml
# Declare files that should be moved to the runtime container:
[build]
assets = [
  "file.txt", # include file.txt
  "frontend/dist/*", # include all files and subdirs in frontend/dist/
  "static/*", # include all files and subdirs in static/
]
```

Lastly, set up your project's web framework to serve them from their directory.

An example on how to do this with Axum can be found [here](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/tree/main/axum/static-files).

## Files at runtime

You app can use the file system like normal, but files in the deployment container are deleted after the deployment shuts down.
