The Shuttle CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary or compiled from source with cargo.
There is also an install script that helps you choose the best option.

## Binaries

<Warning>
After installation, you will have two binaries: `shuttle` and `cargo-shuttle`.

- `shuttle` is used for interacting with the NEW [shuttle.dev](https://www.shuttle.dev) platform.
- `cargo-shuttle` is used for interacting with the older [shuttle.rs](https://www.shuttle.rs) platform.

This documentation covers the NEW [shuttle.dev](https://www.shuttle.dev) platform.
Go to [docs.shuttle.rs](https://docs.shuttle.rs) to view the docs for the shuttle.rs platform.
</Warning>

### Install script

The install script finds the optimal alternative below for installing the latest version on your OS, architecture and distro.

Run it on Linux and macOS with:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash
```

Or on Windows with:

```powershell
iwr https://www.shuttle.dev/install-win | iex
```

### Pre-built binary

Pre-built binaries of the Shuttle CLI for most platforms can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/releases/latest).

The binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall),
which will automatically download the correct binary for your system:

```sh
cargo binstall cargo-shuttle
```

### From source

Although compiling the source code is a bit slower, you can do so with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```

### Distro packages (unofficial)

Shuttle CLI is also packaged by community members for some distros:
