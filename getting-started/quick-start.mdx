<Note>
This page assumes that you have installed Shuttle.
If you haven't, go to the [installation](./installation) guide.
</Note>

## Login

The login command opens the [Shuttle Console](https://console.shuttle.dev/) where you can copy your API key:

```sh
cargo shuttle login
```

## Create your first project

The init command lets you generate a "Hello, World!" project or one of our [examples](/examples) or [templates](/templates).

```sh
cargo shuttle init
```

You can then `cd` into the folder and run your app locally. Check out the [local run](./local-run) page for more.

```sh
cargo shuttle run
```

Then, the app can be deployed with:

```sh
cargo shuttle deploy --allow-dirty
```

<Info>`--allow-dirty` or `--ad` allows deploying with uncommitted git changes.</Info>
