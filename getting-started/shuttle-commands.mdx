## Cookbook / Cheat Sheet

These are some useful sequences of commands that are handy to keep in your back pocket.
For full documentation, use `--help` on the respective command.
Use the global `--debug` flag to print detailed debug output.

- `cargo shuttle login`: Open the Shuttle Console and paste the API key to log in.
- `cargo shuttle init`: Log in and initialize a project.
- `cargo shuttle account`: Check account details.

### Local run

For more tips, see [Local Run](./local-run).

- `cargo shuttle run`: Run the project locally so you can test your changes.
- `cargo shuttle run --port 8080`: Change the local port.
- `cargo shuttle run --port 8080 --external`: Expose to local network by listening on `0.0.0.0`.
- `cargo shuttle run --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this run.
- `cargo shuttle run --release`: Compile with release mode.

### Start and deploy a project

- `cargo shuttle project create`: Start the container for this project on Shuttle.
- `cargo shuttle deploy`: Deploy the project to Shuttle.
- `cargo shuttle deploy --no-follow`: Don't poll deployment state. Alias: `--nf`.
- `cargo shuttle deploy --secrets <file>`: Use a non-default secrets file for this deployment. It must be located in the same folder that Secrets.toml should be in.

### Manage projects

<Tip>
All project-related commands can use:
- `--working-directory <path>` or `--wd <path>` to execute the command in a different folder.
- `--name <name>` to specify project name explicitly (see [Project name](/configuration/project-name)).
- `--id <id>` to specify project id explicitly (see [Project name](/configuration/project-name)).
</Tip>

- `cargo shuttle project list`: List your projects.
- `cargo shuttle project status`: Check the state of this project.
- `cargo shuttle project link`: Link this project folder to a project on Shuttle.
- `cargo shuttle project delete`: Delete a project.

### Manage deployments and logs

- `cargo shuttle deployment list`: List deployments in this project.
- `cargo shuttle deployment status`: Show status of the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle deployment stop`: Stop any currently running deployments.
- `cargo shuttle logs`: Get all logs from the currently running deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs --latest`: Get all logs from the latest deployment.
- `cargo shuttle logs <id>`: Get all logs from a specific deployment.
